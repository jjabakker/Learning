# Standard Error of the mean

## Uniform distribution

Take samples of an increasing size and repeat that 5 times   
The standard deviation decreases with the increasing set size

```{r}

# sd  = 1/12

for (n in c(2, 10, 100, 1000)) {
  
  cat ("\n5 runs for n = ", n, "\n")
  for (i in 1:5) {
    print(sd(runif(n)))
  }
}
```

```{r}
cat("\n")
nosim <- 1000
n <- 10

# Create a matrix of nosim by n 
dat = matrix(runif(nosim * n), nosim, n)

# Calculate the mean for every column
datm = apply(dat, 1, mean)

# Calculate the mean and sd of that column

sdev = sd(datm)
smean = mean(datm)

# For a uniform distrbution tge variance is 1/12
# The SD is sqrt(Var) 
# The SEM is SD / sqrt(n)

var = 1/12
t = sqrt(var)/sqrt(n)
cat('The observed sem is', sdev, 'compared to the theoretical',t)
```


## Normal distribution

```{r}
cat("\n")
nosim <- 1000
n <- 10

# Create a matrix of nosim by n 
dat = matrix(rnorm(nosim * n), nosim, n)

# Calculate the mean for every column
datm = apply(dat, 1, mean)

# Calculate the mean and sd of that column

sdev = sd(datm)
smean = mean(datm)

# For a normal distribution the variance is 1
# The SD is sqrt(Var) 
# The SEM is SD / sqrt(n)

var = 1
t = sqrt(var)/sqrt(n)
cat('The observed sem is', sdev, 'compared to the theoretical',t)
```


## Poisson distribution

```{r}
cat("\n")
nosim <- 1000
n <- 10

# Create a matrix of nosim by n 
dat = matrix(rpois(nosim * n, 4), nosim, n)

# Calculate the mean for every column
datm = apply(dat, 1, mean)

# Calculate the mean and sd of that column

sdev = sd(datm)
smean = mean(datm)

# For a poisson(4) distribution the variance is 4
# The SD is sqrt(Var) 
# The SEM is SD / sqrt(n)

var = 4
t = sqrt(var)/sqrt(n)
cat('The observed sem is', sdev, 'compared to the theoretical',t)
```
